Hello there! Welcome to my page!

My name is Jaehyun Shim, and I'm a sophomore at the University of Michigan, majoring in Computer Science and minoring in Mathematics.

I love coding.

For this summer, I'll be interning at Ansys. I am always looking for more opportunities and love learning new stuff!
